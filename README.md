## Example: Beat 13,000 Data Scientists on Titanic in 5 Minutes

The **Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster** competition on Kaggle is a classic binary classification problem. The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as their age, ticket class, gender, and more. With over 13,000 participants, it's a highly competitive challenge.

Using this tool, you can train a machine learning model on the Titanic dataset in just **10 minutes** and achieve a **top 4% ranking**, beating thousands of data scientists—all with just 10 lines of code and no prior machine learning experience.

Here’s the code to get started:

```python
run_kaggle_automl(
    competition_name='titanic',
    label_column='Survived',
    id_column='PassengerId',
    time_limit=600,  # 10 minutes
    presets='best_quality'
)
